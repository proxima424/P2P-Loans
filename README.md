** P2P  Loans **

Initially I am planning this to be just an onchain
borrowing and lending interface for already sanctioned
loans offchain . 
Basically , it will just process and track payments of
timely payments of loans .

Initial version will be for loans sanctioned without any collateral .
So there has to be high level of trust between two parties . The scenario 
can be like A has agreed to give loan to B in any cryptocurrency at a fixed
interest rate . A will sanction this loan using our interface and B will 
process all the payments through our interface .
